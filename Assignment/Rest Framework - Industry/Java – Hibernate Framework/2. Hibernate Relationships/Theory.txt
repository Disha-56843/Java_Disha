Que: Object Relationships in Hibernate.

Ans.

How Hibernate Handles Relationships:
Hibernate can manage relationships between Java objects, just like relationships in a database.

Types of Relationships:

1)One-to-One: One object is related to one other object. Example: A User has one Profile.

2)One-to-Many: One object is related to many objects. Example: A Department has many Employees.

3)Many-to-One: Many objects relate to one object. Example: Many Orders belong to one Customer.

4)Many-to-Many: Many objects are related to many objects. Example: Many Students can enroll in many Courses.

Que: Mapping Relationships in Hibernate.

Ans.

Annotations:

Use annotations like @OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, and @ManyToMany in your Java classes to define relationships.

Owning vs. Inverse Side:
The owning side manages the relationship in the database, while the inverse side is just a reference.

Cascade Types:
Cascade ensures that when you perform an operation (like save or delete) on one object, it automatically applies to related objects.
