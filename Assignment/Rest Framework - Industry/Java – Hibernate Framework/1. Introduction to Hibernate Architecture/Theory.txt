Que: What is Hibernate?

Ans.

Definition: Hibernate is a Java framework that makes it easy to work with databases by allowing you to use Java objects to store and retrieve data. It eliminates the need to write a lot of SQL queries manually.

Why Hibernate is Better Than JDBC:
In JDBC, you have to write SQL queries and handle database connections manually, which can be complicated.
In Hibernate, most of this work is automated, and you can focus on your Java code instead of SQL.

Advantages of Hibernate:
Works with any database: Hibernate can work with different databases without changing your code.
Creates tables automatically: Hibernate can generate tables based on your Java classes.
Simpler queries: Hibernate uses HQL (Hibernate Query Language), which is easier to use than SQL because it works with objects, not database tables.

Que: Hibernate Architecture:

Ans.

1)Key Components:

SessionFactory:
This is like a factory for creating Session objects. It is set up once when the application starts.

Session:
This is the main part you use to interact with the database. It helps you save, update, or fetch data.

Transaction:
This ensures that a group of database operations either succeed completely or fail without affecting the data.

Query:
Used to write HQL queries to fetch or modify data.

Criteria:
A tool to build flexible and dynamic queries in Java without writing SQL or HQL directly.

2) How Hibernate Works:

*Hibernate reads configuration details from a file (e.g., hibernate.cfg.xml) where database info is stored.
*A SessionFactory is created using this configuration.
*Session objects are created from the SessionFactory to interact with the database.
*Hibernate converts Java object operations into SQL queries and executes them on the database.
