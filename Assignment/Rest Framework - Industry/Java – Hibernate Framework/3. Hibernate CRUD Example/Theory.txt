Que: Understanding CRUD Operations in Hibernate.

Ans.

CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete):

Create: Use session.save() to add new data to the database.
Read: Use session.get() to fetch data from the database.
Update: Use session.update() to modify existing data.
Delete: Use session.delete() to remove data from the database.

Que: Writing HQL (Hibernate Query Language) .

Ans.

What is HQL?
HQL is like SQL, but instead of working with tables and columns, it works with Java objects and their properties.

Examples:
Fetch data: FROM User WHERE age > 18
Update data: UPDATE User SET name = 'John' WHERE id = 1
Delete data: DELETE FROM User WHERE id = 2

 Criteria API:
If you donâ€™t know the exact query in advance, you can use the Criteria API to build queries programmatically. It is flexible and avoids writing query strings directly.
