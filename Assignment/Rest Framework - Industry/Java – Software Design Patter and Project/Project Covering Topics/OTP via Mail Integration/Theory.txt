Que: Introduction to OTP (One-Time Password) and its importance in enhancing security.

Ans.

OTP (One-Time Password) is a password that is valid for only one login session or transaction. It is used to enhance security by ensuring that even if someone obtains the password, they cannot use it again. OTPs are often used in multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems to provide an additional layer of security during login or sensitive transactions.
