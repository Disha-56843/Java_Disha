Que: How to integrate payment gateways into web applications.

Ans.

1) Choose a Payment Gateway: Select a payment gateway like PayPal or Stripe.
2) Obtain API Keys: Register with the payment provider to get the necessary API keys or credentials.
3) Integrate API: Use the provider's SDK or API to integrate the payment functionality into your web application. For example, you can create a payment form that submits to the gatewayâ€™s API, which then processes the transaction.
4) Handle the Response: After the payment is processed, the gateway will send a response, which you need to handle to confirm the payment.

Example with Stripe:

Stripe.apiKey = "your_api_key";
Charge charge = Charge.create(params); // params include amount, currency, etc.
