Que: What is REST (Representational State Transfer)?

Ans.

Overview:
REST is a design approach for building web services.

Key Principles:

1)Statelessness: Each request contains all required information.
2)Resource-Based URLs: Resources are identified using unique URLs.
3)HTTP Methods: Used to perform actions like retrieving or updating data.
4)Status Codes: Provides feedback (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found).

Key REST Concepts

1)Resources: Everything (e.g., users, products) is treated as a resource.
2)URI: Unique address for each resource.
3)Stateless Communication: Each client-server interaction is independent.
