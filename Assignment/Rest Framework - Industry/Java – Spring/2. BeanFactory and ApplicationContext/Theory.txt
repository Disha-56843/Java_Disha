Que: Spring Beans

Ans.

What is a Bean?
A bean is any object that Spring manages for you.

Bean Scopes:

*Singleton: Only one instance is created (default).
*Prototype: A new instance is created each time you need it.
*Request/Session: Used for web applications to create instances per request or session.

Bean Lifecycle:
Spring creates a bean, initializes it, and later destroys it when it's no longer needed.
